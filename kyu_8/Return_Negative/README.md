# Return Negative

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

### Examples

``` text
Input:  1  =>  Output: -1
Input: -5  =>  Output: -5
Input:  0  =>  Output:  0
```

``` go

MakeNegative(1)    // return -1
MakeNegative(-5)   // return -5
MakeNegative(0)    // return 0

```

### Notes

- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
